But our fish said, "No! No!
UP-UP-UP with a fish!"
"Put me down!" said the fish.
Put me down!" said the fish.
I can hold up the fish!
And the fish on a rake!
And our fish came down, too.
Said our fish as he lit.
Said the fish to the cat.
Said the fish in the pot.
To the fish in the pot.
But our fish said, "No! No!
Said the fish in the pot.
"Have no fear, little fish,"
Said the fish in the pot.
Then our fish said, "Look! Look!"
And our fish shook with fear.
"So, DO something! Fast!" said the fish.
"That is good," said the fish.
And the ship, and the fish.
THREE TREE Three fish in a tree.
One fish, Two fish, Red fish, Blue fish,
Black fish, Blue fish, Old fish, New fish.
Say! What a lot of fish there are.
Then I say, "I wish for fish!"
And I get fish right on my dish.
you may swish for fish with my Ish wish dish.
